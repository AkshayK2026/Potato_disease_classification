Project Overview

This repository contains code to train a convolutional neural network to classify potato leaf images into disease categories (for example: healthy, early_blight, late_blight). The repo includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference utilities, plus a minimal API and a simple frontend example to quickly demo predictions.

# Potato Disease Classification

## Setup for Python:

1. Install Python ([Setup instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide))

2. Install Python packages

```


## Training the Model

1. Download the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).
2. Only keep folders related to Potatoes.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook in Browser.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `training/potato-disease-training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. In cell #2, update the path to dataset.
6. Run all the Cells one by one.
7. Copy the model generated and save it with the version number in the `models` folder.
